# Machine Learning Project

This is a machine learning project mainly geared towards developing a model for a real estate business while illustrating every step.

## Objectives
- **Look at the Big Picture:** Understand the project's objectives and how machine learning can contribute to achieving them.
- **Get the Data:** Collect the necessary data for your project from reliable sources.
- **Explore and Visualize the Data:** Analyze the data to gain insights and understand its characteristics through visualizations.
- **Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms:** Clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features as needed.
- **Select a Model and Train It:** Choose a suitable machine learning model based on your problem type (e.g., regression, classification) and train it on the prepared data.
- **Fine-Tune Your Model:** Optimize your model by tuning hyperparameters and evaluating its performance using validation data.
- **Present Your Solution:** Communicate your findings, insights, and the performance of your model to stakeholders in a clear and understandable manner.
- **Launch, Monitor, and Maintain Your System:** Deploy your model into production, monitor its performance, and maintain it over time to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.
